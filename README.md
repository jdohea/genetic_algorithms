# Genetic Algorithms

As part of an "Intelligent Systems" course my classmate and I were tasked with developing a genetic algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.

We developed a framework of common components that is used in every genetic algorithm, no matter what the problem to be solved is, and applied them to the problems we were tasked with solving. We developed various multiple crossover methods, selections methods, and mutation methods for each, all outlined in our report: [A Genetic Algorithm for the 0-1 Knapsack
and TSP](GA_report.pdf)
